TITLE

G.R. No. 190640, January 12, 2011
PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. LUIS PAJARIN Y DELA CRUZ AND EFREN PALLAYA Y TUVIERA, APPELLANTS.


NATURE OF THE CASE

This case is about the need for the prosecution and all law enforcement agencies involved in illegal drugs operations to ensure proper observance of the rules governing entrapment of peddlers of prohibited substances.


FACTS

• The prosecution presented PO2 Nestor Lehetemas, member of the buy-bust team and PO2 James Nolan Ibañez, the poseur-buyer.

• They testified that on June 1, 2005 at around 10:00 p.m., an informant arrived at their Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) with the report that drugs would be sold on P. Ocampo and Dominga Streets the next day at around 5:00 pm.

• As the poseur-buyer, PO2 Ibañez marked a P500.00 bill with SAID on top of its serial number.

• On June 2, 2005 the buy-bust team went to the site of the operation on board a Tamaraw FX which they parked near Dominga Street.

• They stood 10 to 20 steps away beside a red scooter.

• PO2 Ibañez and the informant approached them.

• Chemistry Report D-369-05 showed that upon examination of the submitted specimen, the same yielded positive result for Methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated drug.

• Pallaya asked for a warrant of arrest or a search warrant but he got no response from them.

• In Criminal Case 05-237757, the RTC sentenced Pajarin to suffer 12 years and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months of imprisonment and to pay a fine of P300,000.00.

• On appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR-HC 03291, the latter rendered a decision dated September 30, 2009, affirming the RTC decision, hence the present appeal to this Court.




ISSUES

Accused Pajarin and Pallaya raise two issues:

Whether or not the CA erred in not excluding the evidence of the seized shabu on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove their integrity by establishing the chain of custody of the same until they got to the trial court; and

Whether or not for this reason the CA erred in affirming their conviction.




RULING

The Court has held in numerous cases that the failure of the police to comply with the procedure laid down in R.A. 9165 would not render void the seizure of the prohibited substance for as long as the apprehending officers give justifiable reason for their imperfect conduct and show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated items had not been compromised.

Here, the police officers did not mark the sealed plastic sachets to show that they were the same things they took from the accused.

Here, the record fails to show this.

The prosecutors conducting preliminary investigation should not file in court drugs cases where the sworn statements of the police officers, the report of the chemical analyst, and the object evidence do not show compliance with the same.

And trial courts should order the case dismissed and the accused released from detention if on examination the supporting documents are wanting in this respect.

They should not waste their precious time to useless exercise where the police and the prosecution fail to observe the rule of law especially in so serious offenses.

The Court orders their immediate RELEASE from custody unless they are being held for some other lawful cause.

WHEREFORE, the Court REVERSES and SETS ASIDE the decision of the Court of Appeals dated September 30, 2009 in CA-G.R. CR-HC 03291 as well as the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 2, in Criminal Cases 05-237756 and 05-237757, and ACQUITS the accused-appellants Luis Pajarin and Efren Pallaya on the ground of reasonable doubt.
