TITLE

G.R. No. 218592, August 02, 2017
CHRISTOPHER FIANZA A.K.A. "TOPEL," PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENT.


NATURE OF THE CASE

Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari are the Decision dated November 24, 2014 and the Resolution dated May 29, 2015 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 35293, which upheld the Decision dated September 6, 2012 of the Regional Trial Court of Tayug, Pangasinan, Branch 52 (RTC) in Criminal Case Nos. T-5144 and T-5145, finding petitioner Christopher Fianza a.k.a. "Topel" (Fianza) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of violation of Section 5 (b), Article III of Republic Act No. (RA) 7610, otherwise known as the "Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act."


FACTS

• After AAA was finished with the laundry, Fianza asked her to go with him to the kamalig.

• Thereat, they proceeded to the second floor where Fianza removed his pants and briefs, lied down, and ordered AAA to hold his penis and masturbate him.

• After ejaculating, Fianza put on his clothes, and gave P20.00 to AAA who, thereafter, went home.

• On November 30, 2010, while AAA was home, Fianza called her to his house, and asked her to clean the same.

• He averred that in July 2010, he went to Sapinit to gamble all night, and went to his parents' house the following morning to sleep before going home to Andalasi.

•  As for the November 30, 2010 incident, he maintained that he was in Andalasi drinking with his friends as he had just sold a carabao.

• The next day, he went to get the carabao that he sold, and bought more liquor.

• In a Decision dated September 6, 2012, the RTC found Fianza guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of violation of Section 5 (b), Article III of RA 7610, and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an indeterminate period of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal minimum, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal medium, as maximum, and ordered him to pay AAA the amount of P30,000.00 as moral damages for each count.

• The RTC held that for an accused to be convicted of child abuse through lascivious conduct on a minor below 12 years old, the requisites for acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) must be met in addition to the requisites of sexual abuse under Section 5 of RA 7610, which the prosecution was able to establish.

• It gave full faith and credence to the testimony of AAA who remained steadfast in her claim and who was not shown to have been impelled by any ill-motive to testify falsely against Fianza.

•  On the other hand, it declared that Fianza's actions showed that he took advantage of AAA's naivete and innocence to satisfy his lewd designs.

• Aggrieved, Fianza elevated his conviction to the CA, docketed as CA-G.R. CR No. 35293.

• In a Decision dated November 24, 2014, the CA upheld Fianza's conviction for two (2) counts of violation of Section 5 (b), Article III of RA 7610.

• The CA observed that while Fianza was charged with violations of Section 5 (b), Article III of RA 7610 (sexual abuse), the proper appellation of the crimes should be violations of Article 336 of the RPC (Acts of Lasciviousness), in relation to Section 5 (b), Article III of RA 7610, and found that the prosecution was able to establish all the requisites for both Acts of Lasciviousness and sexual abuse.

• Dissatisfied, Fianza moved for reconsideration, which was, however, denied in a Resolution dated May 29, 2015; hence, this petition.




ISSUES

The Issue Before the Court

The essential issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the CA correctly upheld Fianza's conviction.




RULING

At the outset, the Court deems it appropriate to correct the appellation of the crime with which Fianza was charged to Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC considering that the victim, AAA, was only 11 years old at the time of the incidents.

In instances where the child subjected to sexual abuse through lascivious conduct is below twelve (12) years of age, the offender should be prosecuted under Article 336 of the RPC, but suffer the higher penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period in accordance with Section 5 (b), Article III of RA 7610, which pertinently reads:

Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse.

- Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse.

The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:

(b) Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victims [sic] is under twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815, as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct, as the case may be; Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion temporal in its medium period x x x.

(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

The term "lewd" is commonly defined as something indecent or obscene; it is characterized by or intended to excite crude sexual desire.

The term "influence" means the "improper use of power or trust in any way that deprives a person of free will and substitutes another's objective."

Those of tender years deserve its protection.

Thus, the law should protect her from the harmful consequences of her attempts at adult sexual behavior.

Records likewise indicate that Fianza was about 35 years old at the time of the commission of the offense, or 24 years older than AAA, more or less.

The age disparity between them clearly placed Fianza in a stronger position over AAA which enabled him to wield his will on the latter.

In this relation, Section 6, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court (Rules), which lays down the guidelines in determining the sufficiency of a complaint or information, provides:

Sufficiency of complaint or information.

Conformably with these provisions, when the date given in the complaint is not of the essence of the offense, it need not be proven as alleged; thus, the complaint will be sustained if the proof shows that the offense was committed at any date within the period of the statute of limitations and before the commencement of the action.

It is likewise well-settled that it is sufficient that the acts or omissions constituting the offense be stated in the information in ordinary and concise language and not necessarily in the language used in the statute, albeit in terms sufficient to enable a person of common understanding to know what offense is being charged and for the court to pronounce judgment.

Force or intimidation in cases involving prosecutions for Rape and Acts of Lasciviousness is defined as "power, violence or constraint exerted upon or against a person.

" In People v. Maceda, the Court explained the standards for evaluating the force or intimidation employed in rape, which equally applies to Acts of Lasciviousness as well as violation of Section 5 (b), Article III of RA 7610:

[I]t is not necessary that the force and intimidation employed in accomplishing it be so great or of such character as could not be resisted.

It is only necessary that the force or intimidation be sufficient to consummate the purpose which the accused had in mind.

 (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)

It is sufficient that some compulsion equivalent to intimidation annuls or subdues the free exercise of the will of the offended party.

The Decision dated November 24, 2014 and the Resolution dated May 29, 2015 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 35293 are hereby SET ASIDE and a new one is entered finding petitioner Christopher Fianza a.k.a. "Topel" (Fianza) GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of two (2) counts of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5 (b), Article III of Republic Act No. 7610.

Fianza is sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of twelve (12) years and one (1) day of reclusion temporal in its minimum period, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months, and twenty (20) days of reclusion temporal in its medium period, as maximum, and is ordered to pay AAA the amounts of P15,000.00 as fine, P20,000.00 as civil indemnity, and P15,000.00 as moral damages, for each count, plus legal interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the finality of this judgment until full payment.

WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.
