Whether or not accused-appellant's guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt.




RULING

The crime of Robbery with Rape is penalized under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by Section 9 of Republic Act No. 7659.

Robbery with Rape is a special complex crime under Article 294 of the RPC.

It contemplates a situation where the original intent of the accused was to take, with intent to gain, personal property belonging to another and rape is committed on the occasion thereof or as an accompanying crime.

In People v. Tamayo, the Court ruled that:

AAA's testimony was straightforward, candid and consistent on material points detailing the bestial act of accused Noel Baac in ravishing her.

No young and decent woman in her right mind especially of tender age as that of AAA who is 18 years old would concoct a story of defloration, allow the examination of her private parts and thereafter pervert herself by being subjected to a public trial, if she was not motivated solely by her desire to obtain justice for the wrong committed against her.

It was easy for them to negotiate the distance between their house and the victims' house.

Their place of residence and the place where the crime was committed are both situated in Barangay Sta.

Ergo, his conviction is sustained.

The CA correctly noted that the imposable penalty upon accused­-appellant should have been death considering that the aggravating circumstance of dwelling was alleged in the Information and proven.

However, with the passage of R.A. No. 9346 prohibiting the imposition of the death penalty, the trial court correctly reduced the penalty of death to reclusion perpetua, without eligibility for parole.

Clearly, the imposable penalty against accused-appellant is death.

However, by reason of R.A. No. 9346 as stated above, the penalty was reduced to reclusion perpetua.

In view hereof, the CA's award of civil indemnity in the amount of PhP 75,000, moral damages in the amount of PhP 75,000, and exemplary damages in the amount of PhP 30,000 to AAA, must be modified pursuant to the guidelines laid down in People v. Jugueta, to wit:

For Simple Rape/Qualified Rape:

    a. Civil indemnity - PhP 100,000.00

The CA's order directed against accused-appellant to pay, jointly and severally with Marvin.

The CA on the matter held that:

WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is DISMISSED.

The Decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR-HC No. 05774 dated April 22, 2014, finding accused-appellant Marlon Belmonte GUILTY of the crime of Robbery with Rape is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that the accused-appellant is ORDERED to pay AAA civil indemnity of PhP 100,000, moral damages of PhP 100,000, and exemplary damages of PhP 100,000.

Interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum is imposed on all the damages awarded in this case from date of finality of this Decision until fully paid.

The rest of the assailed CA Decision STANDS.
