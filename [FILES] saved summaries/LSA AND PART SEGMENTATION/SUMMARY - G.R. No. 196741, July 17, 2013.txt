TITLE

G.R. No. 196741, July 17, 2013
PHILIPPINE TOURISM AUTHORITY (Now known AS TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENTERPRISE ZONE AUTHORITY), PETITIONER, VS. MARCOSA A. SABANDAL-HERZENSTIEL, PEDRO TAPALES, LUIS TAPALES, AND ROMEO TAPALES, RESPONDENTS.


NATURE OF THE CASE

Before the Court is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the January 11, 2011 Decision and April 14, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 03888 which declared respondent Marcosa A. Sabandal-Herzenstiel (Sabandal-Herzenstiel) as the lawful possessor of Lot No. 2574, situated in Brgy. Basdiot, Moalboal, Cebu (subject property).


FACTS

• Petitioner made demands to vacate, the last of which was through a letter dated January 5, 1998, which respondents ignored, prompting the filing of a forcible entry complaint against them before the 12th Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Moalboal-Alcantara-Badian-Alegria, Cebu (MCTC), docketed as Civil Case No. 118, on March 18, 1998.

•  They, however, claimed that the sale was tainted with force and intimidation and hence void, including the subsequent transactions covering the same property.

•  On the other hand, Sabandal-Herzenstiel never claimed to be the owner of the same and even acknowledged petitioner's ownership when she offered to buy back the land.

• On January 30, 2008, respondents' appeal to the RTC was dismissed for their failure to file a memorandum on appeal as required under Section 7(b), Rule 40 of the Rules of Court (Rules).

•  Their motion for reconsideration was similarly denied in an Order dated April 23, 2008.

• Only Sabandal-Herzenstiel elevated the matter before the CA via a petition for review under Rule 42 of the Rules.

• On January 11, 2011, the CA rendered the assailed Decision, nullifying and setting aside the rulings of both the MCTC and RTC, and declaring Sabandal-Herzenstiel as the lawful possessor of the subject property.

• On the merits, the CA found petitioner to have failed to establish prior possession of the subject property and rebut respondents' claim of continued physical possession in spite of the sale of the subject property to Tri-Island during which, Sabandal-Herzenstiel leased and converted the property into a resort.

• Petitioner moved for reconsideration which was, however, denied in a Resolution dated April 14, 2011.

• Hence, the instant petition.




ISSUES

The Issue Before the Court

The sole issue for the Court's resolution is whether or not the respondents may be lawfully ejected from the subject property.




RULING

The petition is meritorious.

In an action for forcible entry, the plaintiff must prove that he was in prior possession of the disputed property and that the defendant deprived him of his possession by any of the means provided for in Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules, namely: force, intimidation, threats, strategy, and stealth.

Unlawfully entering the subject property and excluding therefrom the prior possessor would necessarily imply the use of force and this is all that is necessary.

In order to constitute force, the trespasser does not have to institute a state of war.

In the instant case, it is, thus, irrefutable that respondents sufficiently alleged that the possession of the subject property was wrested from them through violence and force.

And in David v. Cordova:

In fine, the Court upholds the findings and conclusions of the MCTC, adjudging petitioner to be the lawful possessor of the subject property, square as they are with existing law and jurisprudence.

The April 13, 2007 Decision of the 12th Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Moalboal-Alcantara-Badian-Alegria, Cebu in Civil Case No. 118 is REINSTATED.

WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED.

The January 11, 2011 Decision and April 14, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City, in CA-G.R. SP No. 03888 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.
