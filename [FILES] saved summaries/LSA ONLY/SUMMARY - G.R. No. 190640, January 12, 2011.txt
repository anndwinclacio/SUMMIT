654 Phil. 461   SECOND DIVISION  G.R. No. 190640, January 12, 2011  PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. LUIS PAJARIN Y DELA CRUZ AND EFREN PALLAYA Y TUVIERA, APPELLANTS. 

The City Prosecutor of Manila charged the accused Luis Pajarin and Efren Pallaya before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila in Criminal Cases 05-237756 and 05-237757 with violation of Section 5 in relation to Sections 26 and 11 (3) in relation to Section 13, respectively, of Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. The prosecution presented PO2 Nestor Lehetemas, member of the buy-bust team and PO2 James Nolan Ibañez, the poseur-buyer. They testified that on June 1, 2005 at around 10:00 p.m., an informant arrived at their Station Anti-Illegal Drugs (SAID) with the report that drugs would be sold on P. Ocampo and Dominga Streets the next day at around 5:00 pm. They stood 10 to 20 steps away beside a red scooter. PO2 Ibañez and the informant approached them. Pajarin opened the compartment of the red scooter and took from it one heat-sealed transparent plastic sachet containing a white crystalline substance. PO2 Ibañez's companions immediately rushed to the group. Pajarin tried to escape but PO2 Lehetemas got hold of him. The arresting officers turned over the seized suspected shabu to PO3 Roel Young who marked the plastic sachet seized from the scooter with the letters "ETP," and the sachet Pajarin handed over with the letters "LDCP." The defense had a completely different version. The Court has held in numerous cases that the failure of the police to comply with the procedure laid down in R.A. 9165 would not render void the seizure of the prohibited substance for as long as the apprehending officers give justifiable reason for their imperfect conduct[1] and show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the confiscated items had not been compromised. Drug enforcement agencies should continually train their officers and agents to observe these rules and transfer out those who would not. They should not waste their precious time to useless exercise where the police and the prosecution fail to observe the rule of law especially in so serious offenses. SO ORDERED.
