769 Phil. 848   FIRST DIVISION  G.R. No. 208984, September 16, 2015  WT CONSTRUCTION, INC., PETITIONER, VS. THE PROVINCE OF CEBU, RESPONDENT.  G.R. No. 209245]   PROVINCE OF CEBU, PETITIONER, VS. WT CONSTRUCTION, INC., RESPONDENT. 

D E C I S I O N Sometime in 2005, the Province of Cebu was chosen by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to host the 12th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit scheduled on December 10, 2006. To cater to the event, it decided to construct the Cebu International Convention Center (CICC or the project) at the New Mandaue Reclamation Area, Mandaue City, Cebu, which would serve as venue for the ASEAN Summit. [5] Accordingly, the Province of Cebu conducted a public bidding for the project and, on February 22, 2006, WTCI emerged as the winning bidder for the construction of Phase I thereof which consists of the substructure of CICC. On July 26, 2006, after completing Phase I and receiving payment therefor, WTCI again won the bidding for Phase II of the project involving the adjacent works on CICC. As Phase II neared completion, the Province of Cebu caused WTCI to perform additional works on the project which included site development, and additional structural, architectural, electric, and plumbing works (additional works). Cognizant of the need to complete the project in time for the ASEAN Summit, and with the repeated assurances that it would be promptly paid, WTCI agreed to perform the additional works notwithstanding the lack of public bidding. [7] In November 2006, weeks before the scheduled ASEAN Summit, WTCI completed the project, including the additional works and, accordingly, demanded payment therefor. In the letters dated March 20, 2007[13] and September 11, 2007,[14] WTCI again reiterated its demand for payment but the Province of Cebu still refused to pay. Thus, on January 22, 2008, WTCI filed a complaint[15] for collection of sum of money before the RTC which was docketed as Civil Case No. CEB-34012. The RTC Ruling In a Judgment[19] dated May 20, 2009, the RTC ruled in favor of WTCI and ordered the Province of Cebu to pay the following amounts: (a) P263,263,261.41 representing the cost of the additional works, with legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum computed from the filing of the complaint on January 22, 2008 until fully paid; (b) P50,000.00 as attorney's fees; and (c) costs of suit. The Province of Cebu sought a reconsideration[22] of the foregoing and argued that its valuation of the additional works was only P257,413,911.73. [49] The Court, therefore, sustains the CA's ruling that the rate of legal interest imposable on the liability of the Province of Cebu to WTCI is 6% per annum, in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals[50] (Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc.), viz. II. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. The foregoing guidelines have been updated in Nacar v. Gallery Frames[52] (Nacar), pursuant to Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Circular No. 799, series of 2013, which reduced the rate of legal interest for loans or transactions involving forbearance of money, goods, or credit from 12% to 6% per annum. The Court is, therefore, constrained to uphold the rulings of the RTC and the CA that the legal interest shall be computed from the time of the filing of the complaint. This is in view of the principle that in the interim, the obligation assumes the nature of a forbearance of credit which, pursuant to Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. as modified by Nacar, is subject to legal interest at the rate of 6% per annum. SO ORDERED.
