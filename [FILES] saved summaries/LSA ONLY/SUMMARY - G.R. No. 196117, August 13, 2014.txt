D E C I S I O N PERLAS-BERNABE, J.: 0-206. [7]  On the strength of a contract to sell[8] which was notarized on July 10, 1962 and a Deed of Sale[9] dated August 23, 1962 purporting to convey Domingo's one-half (½) share of the said lot to Caridad Rodrigueza (Caridad), as well as a Deed of Absolute Sale[10] dated December 5, 1994 whereby Mariano and Caridad (the Rodriguezas) transferred their respective rights to the subject lot in favor of petitioner Krystle Realty Development Corporation (Krystle Realty), the original certificate of title was cancelled. In lieu thereof, three (3) TCTs were issued all on the same day of December 5, 1994, as follows: TCT Nos. 40467 and 40468 in the names of the Rodriguezas at one-half (½) share each, and TCT No. 40469[11] in the name of Krystle Realty covering the entire lot. [12] Claiming that he had not sold his share to Caridad nor received any consideration for the alleged transfer, and that the signature on the deed of sale was not his, Domingo sought to annul the said deed, as well as TCT Nos. 40467, 40468, and 40469, in Civil Case No. 9033 before the RTC of Legazpi City, Branch 4. Caridad, on the other hand, insisted that she had paid Domingo in two (2) installments: ?500.00 as down payment on July 10, 1962, and the balance of P400.00 on August 23, 1962 during which he signed the Deed of Sale. Caridad likewise died, and was substituted first by her brother, Mariano, and upon the latter's death, by Rufino Rodrigueza. [16] Subsequently, the NBI issued Questioned Document Report No. 60-196[17] dated June 14, 1996 stating that the questioned and the standard/sample signatures of Domingo submitted to it for examination were written by one and the same person. Further, the irregularities attending the issuance of TCT Nos. 40467, 40468, and 40469 as pointed out by the CA are equally indicative of lack of good faith on Krystle Realty's part. Indeed, what it failed to realize is that, as one asserting the status of a buyer in good faith and for value, it had the burden of proving such status, which goes beyond a mere invocation of the ordinary presumption of good faith. [43] As the records disclose, petitioners never raised this issue in the appeal in CA-G.R. CV No. 54912 before the CA, and even in the subsequent proceedings before the RTC and the CA in CA-G.R. CV No. Basic considerations of fairness and due process impel this rule. WHEREFORE, the consolidated petitions are DENIED. SO ORDERED.
